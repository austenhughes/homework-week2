        <p>Hi my name is Austen Hughes, and I am located in Denver Colorado. I have a Bachelor’s Degree in Theater (concentration in design) with a minor in psychology. I have just finished a Certificate in Full Stack Web Development at the University of Denver Coding Bootcamp. I found this class to be very rewarding. What I really loved was solving puzzles, working with a team, and being able to see something I built get up and functioning. I also enjoyed planning the visual design and flow when I got to be a part of those decisions. I am excited to spend time growing my knowledge and focusing on the specific languages, and programs I get to use most regularly in the future.  </p> <br />

        <p>Currently I am a manager of a shoe store in downtown Denver. I love my store and my team is awesome. I have been in retail for the last 10 years and with this company for 7 of those. In that time I have moved from senior sales up to store manager and had lots of adventures along the way. The job has allowed me to try many new things, and to meet some of the most interesting people. I now find I am looking for new kinds of challenges.  </p> <br />
    
        <p>When finding a bootcamp I wanted to choose a full stack program so I could start with the bigger picture. I enjoyed all parts of the class from building databases to working out front end functionality with JavaScript. I found each side to have their own quirks and rewards. I will admit I do have a soft spot for styling visuals/css even if it a small part of many projects. I am creative, results driven and looking for a supportive environment to build my skills.  </p> <br />
    
        <p>A little bit more about myself : I like the mountains, more in the summer than the winter. I like most kinds of tea. I have a really cool dog named Sir Robin (the not so brave). I’m a fan of cheesy jokes … and cheese the food. I like audiobooks, and doing craft project with friends, I also really like the feeling of working out a problem after pulling it apart once or twice. </p> <br />
