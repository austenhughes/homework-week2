portfolio project

Hi my name is Austen Hughes and this is my portfolio project. the site is orginised into the folowing three pages:

- first is an about me page. here you will find info about me and a link to my linkedin acount. 
- the second is the portfolio itself. the portfolio will conatin links to projects I hvae compleeted. I will build on this as I have things to add.
- the last is a contact page. this page is set up wiht three submtion boxes the frist two asking for your name and email repsectivly the last is a larger space to leave a coment or ask a qeustion. 

to navigate this page you will use the naveigation bar at the top. on large viewport you will find the three pages/links listed by name. when the view port is at med or smaller this bar will become a dropdown menu containg the options formerly found on nav bar.

all images in this project can be found in a folder named pictures wich inside another folder names assets.

you should not have to add anything to your computer to use this site.
